<h1>Ozymandias </h1>
<p><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93343">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a></p>
<div>I met a traveller from an antique land<br>Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,<br>Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command<br>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>Which yet survive, stamped on those lifeless things,<br> The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:<br>And on the pedestal these words appear:<br>"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br>Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!"<br>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br>The lone and level sands stretch far away.<br>
