<h1>To Napoleon</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q981572">John Clare</a></p>
<div>The heroes of the present and the past<br>Were puny, vague, and nothingness to thee:<br>Thou didst a span grasp mighty to the last,<br>And strain for glory when thy die was cast.<br>That little island, on the Atlantic sea,<br>Was but a dust-spot in a lake: thy mind<br>Swept space as shoreless as eternity.<br>Thy giant powers outstript this gaudy age<br>Of heroes; and, as looking at the sun,<br>So gazing on thy greatness, made men blind<br>To merits, that had adoration won<br>In olden times. The world was on thy page<br>Of victories but a comma. Fame could find<br>No parallel, thy greatness to presage.<br>
