<div>Ambition, following down this far-famed slope<br>Her Pioneer, the snow-dissolving Sun,<br>While clarions prate of Kingdoms to be won,<br>Perchance, in future ages, here may stop;<br>Taught to mistrust her flattering horoscope<br>By admonition from this prostrate Stone;<br>Memento uninscribed of Pride o'erthrown,<br>Vanity's hieroglyphic;—a choice trope<br>In fortune's rhetoric. Daughter of the Rock,<br>Rest where thy course was stayed by Power Divine!<br>The Soul transported sees, from hint of thine,<br>Crimes which the great Avenger's hand provoke,<br>Hears combats whistling o'er the ensanguin'd heath:<br>What groans! what shrieks! what quietness in death!<br>
