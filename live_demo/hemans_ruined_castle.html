<div>Oh! let me sigh to think this ruin’d pile<br>Was favour'd once with fortune's radiant smile;<br>These moss-grown battlements, these ivy'd towers,<br>Have seen prosperity's uncertain hours;<br>Their heroes triumph'd in the scenes of war,<br>While victory follow'd in her trophied car.<br>Here, where I muse in meditation's arms,<br>Perhaps the battle raged with loud alarms;<br>Here glory's crimson banner waving spread,<br>While laurel crowns entwin'd the victor's head;<br>And here, perhaps, with many a plaintive tear,<br>The mourner has bedew'd the soldier's bier.<br>The scene of conquest pensive fancy draws,<br>Where thousands fell, enthusiasts in their cause.<br>Yon turret, moulder'd by the hand of time,<br>Shaded by silver ash and spreading lime,<br>Was once, perhaps, the hall of mirth and joy,<br>Where warriors sought no longer to destroy;<br>And where, perhaps, the hoary-headed sage,<br>Would lead them o'er the animating page;<br>Where history points to glorious ages fled,<br>And tells the noble actions of the dead.<br>Still fancy with a magic power recalls<br>The time when trophies grac'd the lofty walls:<br>When with enchanting spells the minstrel's art,<br>Could soften and inspire the melting heart;<br>Could raise the glowing elevated flame,<br>And bid the youthful soldier pant for fame:<br>While deeds of glory were the themes he sung,<br>The pleasant harp in wild accordance rung.<br>Ah! where is now the warrior's ardent fire?<br>Where now the tuneful spirit of the lyre?<br>The warrior sleeps; the minstrel's lay is still;<br>No songs of triumph echo from the hill.<br>Ah! yet the weeping muse shall love to sigh,<br>And trace again thy fallen majesty;<br>And still shall Fancy linger on the theme,<br>While forms of heroes animate her dream.<br>
